Web Games Development 1

Module: COMP 09090

*Our Task is to create a Website with an embedded Game via Phaser 3. The Due date is Saturday, November 21st 2020 for the first submission*

This module is core for the BSc Computer Games Development and extends the web and mobile
programming to focus specifically on game development and animation using HTML5 and JavaScript.
The module examines web games programming techniques using JavaScript Game frameworks and
libraries.

The module provides the necessary theoretical background to using such frameworks in game
development, but the focus is on applying these and students will spend much of their time
programming and doing practical development work in the lab sessions.

The module includes a project to develop a web game using the framework. By the end of the
module students will have a solid foundation in developing web-based games.

*• This module aims to consolidate the use of basic web page structuring and style using HTML and
CSS.*

*• The module will encourage the application of structured object-oriented JavaScript code to the
implementation of a game scenario.*
