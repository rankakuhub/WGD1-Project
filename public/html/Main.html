            You play as a hitman, who has been hired by a mafia boss that has tasked you with tracking down and eliminating
            the rival families who pose a threat to the mafia don's drug operation, allowing your employer to gain full control of
            the drug market. Your mission states that you MUST eliminate all who stand in your way of eliminating the
            head of each family, doing so puts you in good favour of your employer and you will be heavily compensated
            for completing your mission in a swift and efficient manner.

            <br/><br/> <b>Can you kill everyone in one life?</b> <br/><br/>

            Make every shot count as you jump into unknown environments with limited vision and ammo. Eliminate as many enemies as
            possible, scavenge their ammo and eliminate the boss until you can escape to collect you reward. Eliminate the
            target within the time given to collect bonus cash from your employers.


            <br/><br/> <b> Get in there and finish the Job!</b>
